# 🛰️ FirstWatch™
### Malicious Domain Registration Monitoring & Early-Stage Threat Intelligence

> **Detect threats at domain creation — not after damage is done.**

---

## 🔍 Overview

**FirstWatch™** is a domain registration monitoring and WHOIS intelligence solution that provides **early visibility into newly registered and potentially abusive domains**.

Many cyber threats — including **phishing, malware delivery, fraud, and brand impersonation** — rely on domains registered shortly before use. Traditional reputation-based security controls typically identify these domains **only after abuse has already occurred**.

FirstWatch shifts detection **upstream in the threat lifecycle**, enabling organizations to identify, investigate, and operationalize intelligence on suspicious domains at the **earliest possible stage**.

---

## ✨ Why Use FirstWatch?

FirstWatch focuses on **domain creation and registration behavior**, rather than waiting for domains to accumulate negative reputation.

Organizations use FirstWatch to:

- 🆕 Monitor newly registered and high-risk domains
- 🧬 Identify brand impersonation and typo‑squatting
- 🎯 Detect infrastructure linked to phishing, fraud, and malware
- 🧾 Enrich investigations with WHOIS, registrar, and nameserver context
- 🔄 Integrate early indicators into security, intelligence, and automation workflows

## 🤖 What the Automation Script Provides

The **FirstWatch API** delivers domain intelligence at scale.  
This automation script operationalizes that data for:

- Security Operations Centers (SOC)
- SOAR platforms
- Threat intelligence teams
- Brand protection and fraud teams
- Research and analytics workflows

### Splunk SOAR (Phantom) Custom Function
- `phantom_custom_function_firstwatch_risk_score.py` — explainable risk scoring for newly registered domains (auditable reasons)

> These templates are intentionally conservative and include **placeholders** for integration command names (e.g., `dns-resolve`, `whois`, `block-domain`).
> Replace placeholders with the commands available in your environment (Palo Alto DNS Security, Proofpoint, Zscaler, Infoblox, Splunk ES, etc.).

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Treat API keys as secrets
- Apply TLP markings appropriately
- Use indicators as early signals, not verdicts
- Avoid blind enforcement
- Secure logs and output data
